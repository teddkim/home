        Hi, I am Taehyun. I also go by Ted. Along with learning through <a href="#courses">courses</a>, I have had many
        opportunities
        to apply what I've learned in classes to real-life <a href="#projects">projects</a> in a team of as few as two
        and as large as ten people. I am always
        devoted to come up with <b>creative</b> solutions and one of the ways I learned to do that is through learning
        new things and
        collaborating and communicating with people as best as I can.
        <br>
        Outside of my "formal" hobbies I enjoy taking trips to places I have never been before whether it bbe new city,
        mountain,
        museum, or some beach and taking photos for my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/teddk16/">instagram</a>.
